# authentication

a simple project of authentication with email validator, background jobs using bee-queue and jwt. this is not a final version,now i will develop the front end, and after improve my backend code.  

You need a redis-server on machine  

yarn start to run the main server  
and yarn queue in another terminal to run the background-jobs that send emails
